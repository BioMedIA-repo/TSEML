- Figure 2: The training paradigm of the proposed TSEML. TSEML leverages the nearest feature centroid approach of ProtoNet and the gradient update inner loop of MAML to enable the model to perform task-specific embeddings for samples.

- Figure 3:  Visual interpretation of high-level embeddings learned by different methods on TCGA Few-Shot. The red, blue, and green arrows highlight the ability of our TSEML to discriminate specific subtypes.

### Dataset
Due to the scarcity of few-shot learning datasets for molecular subtyping, we create anew TCGA Few-Shot dataset, derived from the TCGA datasets.
